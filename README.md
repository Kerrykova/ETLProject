Data sources: Austin Animal Center Outcomes and City of Austin Satisfaction Surveys

Transformation process/steps: 
* Filter, drop and rename columns
* Filter data sets so that they both have the same date range
* Clean data by dropping any duplicates or rows missing data
* Sort the animal dataset so that the results are "grouped by" year

Data destination: MySQL database
